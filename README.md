# SSM-Timetable-Planner
What is this about?

Allow students to plan their courses visually; by following NTU STARS format that allows for dropdown option and display in calendar format. Students can also export to Google calendar format.

How?

Download file `Module1.bas` and follow guide on `Instructions.ipynb`to run code on `main.ipynb`.

*CAVEAT:

If there is more than 1 day shown in the 'Day' column of the timetable given, the 2nd day will be removed. You will have to add it manually, otherwise it will not be available in the dropdown. If unclear, please see guide.

Hope it's helpful. :)
